# Data-Visualization-Portfolio

This repository contains all my **Data Analysis and Visualization projects**, organized under one main folder called **Data Visualization**.  

It brings together different approaches and tools — from **Python-based exploratory analysis** to **dashboarding in Power BI and Tableau**. The goal is to showcase how data can be transformed into actionable insights using a mix of coding, visualization, and analytics.
